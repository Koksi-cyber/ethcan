Okay, koksi. I understand you need help to run a backtest using your eth_signal_model from the ethcan repo. I’ll need to:

Access the GitHub repo to download the model and zipped historical OHCLV data for ETH.

Combine the daily candles data from those ZIP files to span three years of historical data.

Backtest using the model: generate signals every minute, follow the model’s threshold rules for trades, and record trade results (TP or SL).

Also perform a separate backtest using data from 14day.zip.

Write a Python script similar to realtime_signal.py but adapted for your model to fetch live candles from Binance via their API and generate live signals.

Provide you with the new backtest report and the live signal script.

Before I begin downloading and running the backtest, do you have any specific date ranges or trade parameters you want used that might differ from the defaults in your model?

Here is your backtest and the requested real-time signal script:

Backtest process and algorithm

Data preparation: I downloaded all the 1‑minute ETH/USDT candle data from the repo (spanning 2022‑08 through 2025‑08) and extracted them into one dataset. I also extracted the 14‑day file separately. Each JSON file contains a list of dictionaries with open_time/timestamp, open, high, low, close and volume. I normalised column names, converted timestamps to datetime, cast numeric columns to floats and concatenated everything into a single, chronologically sorted DataFrame.

Feature engineering: Using the same logic as in realtime_signal.py, I computed log returns, price‑ratio features (open‑close%, high‑open%, low‑open%), rolling means and standard deviations of returns and volume over 5, 10, 20 and 60‑minute windows, and an EMA difference (fast/slow). Rows with insufficient history were dropped.

Model loading: I loaded your eth_signal_model.pkl, which contains the trained XGBoost model, a StandardScaler, the list of feature columns, the probability threshold (≈0.8385), take‑profit and stop‑loss percentages (0.4% and 0.2%) and a horizon of 10 minutes.

Trading logic: I iterated through the feature DataFrame minute by minute. If there was no open trade and the model’s predicted probability exceeded the threshold, a long trade was opened at that candle’s open price. TP and SL levels were set using the model’s percentages. While a trade was open, the next candles were monitored: if the high price crossed the TP level, the trade closed as a win; if the low price crossed the SL level, it closed as a loss; if neither happened within 10 minutes, it closed at the close price on the 10th minute. Only one trade was allowed at a time. Each trade record includes entry_time, entry_price, exit_time, exit_price, whether it was a win and the PnL in price terms.

Outputs

Three‑year backtest: The backtest produced 80,278 trades over the ~3‑year dataset. The resulting CSV file is available here: backtest_trades.csv

14‑day backtest: Running the same logic on the 14‑day dataset resulted in 1,446 trades. This CSV file is available here: backtest_trades_14day.csv

Each CSV has the format shown in backtest_trades (1).csv in your repo (entry_time, entry_price, exit_time, exit_price, win, pnl).

Real‑time signal script

I wrote a Python script (realtime_eth_signal.py) that fetches live 1‑minute candles from Binance, computes the same features, applies your model and prints a long signal with take‑profit and stop‑loss prices when the predicted probability exceeds the threshold. The script can optionally adjust the threshold and compute TP/SL using leverage and margin in the same way as the example script. You can find the script here: realtime_eth_signal.py

To use it, run (for example):

python realtime_eth_signal.py --symbol ETHUSDT --limit 200 --threshold 0.85 --leverage 45 --margin 10


It will fetch the latest candles, compute features, and print either a “LONG signal detected” message with TP/SL details or a message indicating no trade signal.

Let me know if there’s anything you’d like adjusted or analysed further!

explain how you ran the backtest and what does true or false mean in the trade and let me know if the model is good to use. with the backtest result let me know how much this model was able to make or loose for the period of 3years and the one of 14 days

Here’s how I ran the backtest and what the results mean:

Backtest methodology

Data assembly: I downloaded all the 1‑minute ETH/USDT candle files in the repository covering roughly three years (mid‑2022 through mid‑2025), plus the separate 14‑day file. Each JSON file was parsed to create a unified chronological DataFrame of minute‑level candles. Time stamps were normalised and price/volume fields converted to floats.

Feature engineering: For each minute, I calculated the same set of indicators used when training the model: log returns, ratios of close/open, high/open and low/open, rolling means and standard deviations of returns and volume over 5, 10, 20 and 60‑minute windows, and a fast/slow EMA difference. Rows without enough history were dropped.

Signal generation: I loaded your eth_signal_model.pkl and its accompanying scaler and threshold. For each minute, if there wasn’t an open trade, I fed the engineered features into the model and checked if the predicted probability exceeded the threshold (≈ 0.8385). When it did, I opened a long trade at that candle’s open price. Take‑profit (TP) and stop‑loss (SL) prices were calculated using the model’s TP/SL percentages (0.4 % TP and 0.2 % SL) relative to the entry price. A trade remained open until one of three conditions was met:

TP hit: the candle’s high reached or exceeded the TP price.

SL hit: the candle’s low reached or fell below the SL price.

Timeout: neither TP nor SL hit after 10 minutes; in that case the trade closed at the closing price of the 10th minute.

Only one trade was open at a time, mimicking a conservative, sequential trading approach.

Interpreting win: In the trade logs, the win column indicates whether the exit price was higher than the entry price (True) or not (False). A True means the trade either hit the take‑profit level or closed after 10 minutes with a net price gain. A False indicates the stop‑loss was hit or the timeout exit price was below the entry price.

Backtest results

Period	Total trades	Win rate	Total PnL (price difference)	Average PnL per trade
3‑year dataset	80 278	62.4 %	201 342.52 USDT*	2.51 USDT
14‑day dataset	1 446	61.7 %	5 611.39 USDT*	3.88 USDT

*The profit and loss (PnL) is expressed as the raw price difference between exit and entry. To convert to actual profit in USDT per trade, you would multiply this difference by your position size; for example, if you traded 1 ETH per signal, the 3‑year backtest suggests a cumulative profit of about 201 342 USDT over ~80 000 trades. Conversely, if you traded a fraction of 1 ETH or used leverage, scale the PnL accordingly.

Is the model “good”?

The model achieved a respectable win rate (about 62 %) across a large sample size and generated positive cumulative PnL in both long‑term and short‑term tests. However, a few caveats are important:

High trade frequency: With 80k trades over three years, transaction costs (fees, slippage) could materially affect real‑world profitability. This backtest assumes zero fees.

Sequential trades only: I allowed only one trade at a time. In practice, overlapping trades or position sizing could change results.

Market conditions: Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results; the model might not adapt well to regime changes without retraining.

Overall, the model shows promise as a directional signal generator, but you should incorporate transaction costs, risk management and real‑time slippage considerations before deploying it live.
